/* Discussion: It is clear that the urban area is better than the rural area in
terms of any of consumption, income and wealth, and the disparity is the most
apparent when we talk about wealth. My measure of income per household is 
1289.446 (not reported above), lower than the corresponding result in Magalhaes 
and Santaeul√†lia-Llopis (2017) and consumption per household is 2705.559 (not 
reported again), higher than the corresponding result. Possible reasons are two: 
one is that we use the data for 2013 instead of 2010, so the households covered 
in the data are not the same; the other is that even if the households covered 
are the same, we may have implicitly imposed different sample selection 
criterion, i.e., when cleaning the data, we may delete or keep different 
households. */

/* 2. CIW inequality: 
(1) Show histogram for CIW separately for rural and urban areas; */

/* Starting from here, we will delete nonpositive-income or nonpositive-wealth 
households so as to take logs and do inequality studies. */

/* Discussion: For any of consumption, income and wealth, the distributions in 
the urban area and the rural area are generally similar, i.e., a large group of
people concentrate in the middle. However, the distributions in the urban area 
shift rightward somehow in any of the three cases. This is not surpirsing due to
the presence of more richer households in the urban area, which is consistent
with what we get in Part 1. The dispersions of the distributions are not easily
observabele from the graphs and we need to compute the detailed statistics. The
graphs are in general similar to those in the paper. */

/* Discussion: In any of the three cases, the urban area is more disperse than
the rural area, which is not surprising due to the presence of more hetergeneous
households in the urban area. And, the dispersion in consumption is the lowest,
and that in income is the highest. In Malawi and the US, the dispersion in 
income is lower than that in wealth, so here we are observing something 
different. We do not impose very strict criterion for sample selection, so 
basically most of the households in the survey are in our final dataset for 
analysis, whereas in the paper, the criterion may be stricter. The dispersion in
consumption is similar in both areas whereas in the other two cases the 
difference in between is about a maganitude of 2. */

/* Discussion: Corr(log_con, log_inc) < Corr(log_con, log_wea) < 
Corr(log_inc, log_wea), implying more transmission from income to wealth than 
that from income to consumption. This result differs very much with that of 
Malawi and the US. In the Malawi case, Corr(log_con, log_inc) > 
Corr(log_con, log_wea) > Corr(log_inc, log_wea); in the US case, 
Corr(log_con, log_inc) > Corr(log_inc, log_wea) > Corr(log_con, log_wea). In the 
Uganda case in the paper, Corr(log_con, log_inc) > Corr(log_con, log_wea) > 
Corr(log_inc, log_wea). I do not know why but very likely this is due to my 
improper processing of some variables in the dataset. Considering this, my 
analysis in the other parts is not so belivable. */

/* Discussion: The variance of log_con is quite flat over the life cycle, 
implying a sort of consumption smoothing. However, the variances of log_inc and 
log_wealth become larger as the agent ages. This implies some accumulation 
mechanism, i.e., the rich become richer when being old, while the poor become 
relatively poorer. The variance of log_wea is slightly lower than that of 
log_inc, consistent with the statistics given in Part 2(2). In the last set of
three graphs, the results are not easily interpretable. The correlations seem
to be fluctuating very much when agents become older. */
